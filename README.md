## Google NNLM Text Embedings Model Adapter

---

## Introduction

This repo is a model integration between [Google NNLM text embeddings](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/nnlm/tensorFlow1/en-dim128/1?tfhub-redirect=true) and [Dataloop](https://dataloop.ai/).

## Overview

Text embeddings based on feed-forward Neural-Net Language Models with pre-built OOV. Maps from text to 50-dimensional or 128-dimensional embedding vectors.

## Models

| Language   | 50 dimensions                                     | 128 dimensions                                      |
